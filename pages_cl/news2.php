        <p style="text-indent:40px; text-align:justify;">A log cabin is a house built from logs. It is a fairly simple type 
            of log house. A distinction should be drawn between the traditional meanings of "log cabin" and "log house." 
            Historically most "log cabins" were a simple one- or 1Â½-story structures, somewhat impermanent, and less 
            finished or less architecturally sophisticated than a proper log house. A "log cabin" was usually constructed 
            with round rather than hewn, or hand-worked, 
            logs, and often it was the first generation home building erected quickly for frontier shelter.</p>
        
            <p style="text-indent:40px; text-align:justify;">The payroll module automates the pay process by gathering data on employee time 
            and attendance, calculating various deductions and taxes, and generating periodic 
            pay cheques and employee tax reports. Data is generally fed from the human resources 
            and time keeping modules to calculate automatic deposit and manual cheque writing capabilities. 
            This module can encompass all employee-related transactions as well as integrate with existing financial management systems.
            The time and attendance module gathers standardized time and work related efforts. 
            The most advanced modules provide broad flexibility in data collection methods, labor 
            distribution capabilities and data analysis features. Cost analysis and efficiency metrics are the primary functions.
            The benefits administration module provides a system for organizations to administer 
            and track employee participation in benefits programs. These typically encompass insurance, 
            compensation, profit sharing and retirement.</p>

                <h3>What is HRIS?</h3>
                <justify><p>&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp A HRIS, which is also known as a human resource 
                information system or human resource management system (HRMS), 
                is basically an intersection of human resources and information 
                technology through HR software. This allows HR activities and 
                processes to occur electronically.</p></justify>

                <justify><p>&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbspTo put it another way, a HRIS may be viewed 
                as a way, through software, for businesses big and small to take care of a 
                number of activities, including those related to human resources, accounting, 
                management, and payroll. A HRIS allows a company to plan its HR costs more effectively, 
                as well as to manage them and control them without needing to allocate 
                too many resources toward them.- <a href="http://www.hrpayrollsystems.net/hris/">HRIS</a></p></justify>
