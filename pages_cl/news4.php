        <p style="text-indent:40px; text-align:justify;">A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Flowers give rise to fruit and seeds. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen.
        In addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and used by humans to beautify their environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual, religion, medicine and as a source of food.</p>

                <h3>What is HRIS?</h3>
                <justify><p>&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp A HRIS, which is also known as a human resource 
                information system or human resource management system (HRMS), 
                is basically an intersection of human resources and information 
                technology through HR software. This allows HR activities and 
                processes to occur electronically.</p></justify>

                <justify><p>&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbspTo put it another way, a HRIS may be viewed 
                as a way, through software, for businesses big and small to take care of a 
                number of activities, including those related to human resources, accounting, 
                management, and payroll. A HRIS allows a company to plan its HR costs more effectively, 
                as well as to manage them and control them without needing to allocate 
                too many resources toward them.- <a href="http://www.hrpayrollsystems.net/hris/">HRIS</a></p></justify>
