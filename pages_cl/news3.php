        <p style="text-indent:40px; text-align:justify;">Nature, in the broadest sense, is equivalent to the natural, physical, 
            or material world or universe. "Nature" refers to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. 
            It ranges in scale from the subatomic to the cosmic. The study of nature is science.
            The word nature is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", 
            and in ancient times, literally meant "birth". Natura was a Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), 
            which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the 
            world develop of their own accord. The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one 
            of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις 
            by pre-Socratic philosophers, and has steadily gained currency ever since. 
            This usage continued during the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries</p>
        
                <p style="text-indent:40px; text-align:justify;">Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" 
                    often refers to geology and wildlife. Nature may refer to the general realm of various types of 
                    living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects – 
                    the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather 
                    and geology of the Earth, and the matter and energy of which all these things are composed. 
                    It is often taken to mean the "natural environment" or wilderness–wild animals, rocks, forest, 
                    beaches, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, 
                    or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction 
                    generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or 
                    "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found
                     today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being 
                     understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind. 
                     Depending on the particular context, 
                    the term "natural" might also be distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural.</p>

                <h3>What is HRIS?</h3>
                <justify><p>&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp A HRIS, which is also known as a human resource 
                information system or human resource management system (HRMS), 
                is basically an intersection of human resources and information 
                technology through HR software. This allows HR activities and 
                processes to occur electronically.</p></justify>

                <justify><p>&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbspTo put it another way, a HRIS may be viewed 
                as a way, through software, for businesses big and small to take care of a 
                number of activities, including those related to human resources, accounting, 
                management, and payroll. A HRIS allows a company to plan its HR costs more effectively, 
                as well as to manage them and control them without needing to allocate 
                too many resources toward them.- <a href="http://www.hrpayrollsystems.net/hris/">HRIS</a></p></justify>
